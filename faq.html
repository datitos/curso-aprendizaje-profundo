<h4 id="whatsthegradingpolicyforspring2020">What's the grading policy for Spring 2020?</h4>
<p>According to the official faculty senate legislation, grading will be Satisfactory/No Credit (S/NC) for Spring 2020. We are still deciding on the grading details, and we will be updating them soon.</p>
<h4 id="academicaccommodations">Academic accommodations:</h4>
<p>If you need an academic accommodation based on a disability, you should initiate the request with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE). The OAE will evaluate the request, recommend accommodations, and prepare a letter for faculty. Students should contact the OAE as soon as possible and at any rate in advance of assignment deadlines, since timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. It is the studentâ€™s responsibility to reach out to the teaching staff regarding the OAE letter. Please send your letters to cs231n-spr1920-staff@lists.stanford.edu</p>

### What's the grading policy for Spring 2020?
According to the official faculty senate legislation, grading will be Satisfactory/No Credit (S/NC) for Spring 2020. We are still deciding on the grading details, and we will be updating them soon.

### Academic accommodations:
If you need an academic accommodation based on a disability, you should initiate the request with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE). The OAE will evaluate the request, recommend accommodations, and prepare a letter for faculty. Students should contact the OAE as soon as possible and at any rate in advance of assignment deadlines, since timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. It is the studentâ€™s responsibility to reach out to the teaching staff regarding the OAE letter. Please send your letters to cs231n-spr1920-staff@lists.stanford.edu

### Can I take this course on credit/no cred basis?
Yes. Credit will be given to those who would have otherwise earned a C- or above.

### Can I audit or sit in?
In general we are very open to auditing if you are a member of the Stanford community (registered student, staff, and/or faculty). Out of courtesy, we would appreciate that you first email us or talk to the instructor after the first class you attend.

### Can I work in groups for the Final Project?
Yes, in groups of up to three people.

### I have a question about the class. What is the best way to reach the course staff?
Almost all questions should be asked on Piazza. If you have a sensitive issue you can email the instructors directly.

### Can I combine the Final Project with another course?
Yes, you may; however before doing so you must receive permission from the instructors of both courses.

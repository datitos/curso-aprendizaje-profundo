<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>The Course Project is an opportunity for you to apply what you have learned in class to a problem of your interest. Potential projects usually fall into these two tracks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applications. If you're coming to the class with a specific background and interests (e.g. biology, engineering, physics), we'd love to see you apply ConvNets to problems related to your particular domain of interest. Pick a real-world problem and apply ConvNets to solve it.</li>
<li>Models. You can build a new model (algorithm) with ConvNets, or a new variant of existing models, and apply it to tackle vision tasks. This track might be more challenging, and sometimes leads to a piece of publishable work.</li>
</ul>
<p>One restriction to note is that this is a Computer Vision class, so your project should involve pixels of visual data in some form somewhere. E.g. a pure NLP project is not a good choice, even if your approach involves ConvNets.</p>
<p>To get a better feeling for what we expect from CS231n projects, we encourage you to take a look at the project reports from previous years:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spring 2017</li>
<li>Winter 2016</li>
<li>Winter 2015</li>
</ul>
<p>To inspire ideas, you might also look at recent deep learning publications from top-tier conferences, as well as other resources below.</p>

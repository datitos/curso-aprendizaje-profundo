* Lectures: are on Tuesday/Thursday 4:30-5:50pm Pacific Time (Remote, Zoom link is posted on Canvas).
* Lecture videos for enrolled students: are posted on Canvas (requires login) shortly after each lecture ends. Unfortunately, it is not possible to make these videos viewable by non-enrolled students.
* Publicly available lecture videos and versions of the course: Complete videos from the 2019 edition are available (free!) on the Stanford Online Hub and on the CS224N YouTube channel. Anyone is welcome to enroll in XCS224N: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning, the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Professional Program version of this course, throughout the year (medium fee, community TAs and certificate). You can enroll in CS224N via Stanford online in the (northern hemisphere) Autumn to do the course in the Winter (high cost, gives Stanford credit). The lecture slides and assignments are updated online each year as the course progresses. We are happy for anyone to use these resources, but we are happy to get acknowledgements.
* Office hours: We've switched to using Nooks for office hours. Information here.
* Contact: Students should ask all course-related questions in the Ed forum (not Piazza), where you will also find announcements. For external enquiries, emergencies, or personal matters that you don't wish to put in a private Ed post, you can email us at cs224n-win2021-staff@lists.stanford.edu.

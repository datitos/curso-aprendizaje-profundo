Proyecto

Overview
--------

The Course Project is an opportunity for you to apply what you have learned in class to a problem of your interest. Potential projects usually fall into these two tracks:

* Applications. If you're coming to the class with a specific background and interests (e.g. biology, engineering, physics), we'd love to see you apply ConvNets to problems related to your particular domain of interest. Pick a real-world problem and apply ConvNets to solve it.
* Models. You can build a new model (algorithm) with ConvNets, or a new variant of existing models, and apply it to tackle vision tasks. This track might be more challenging, and sometimes leads to a piece of publishable work.

One restriction to note is that this is a Computer Vision class, so your project should involve pixels of visual data in some form somewhere. E.g. a pure NLP project is not a good choice, even if your approach involves ConvNets.

To get a better feeling for what we expect from CS231n projects, we encourage you to take a look at the project reports from previous years:

* Spring 2017
* Winter 2016
* Winter 2015

To inspire ideas, you might also look at recent deep learning publications from top-tier conferences, as well as other resources below.

* CVPR: IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
* ICCV: International Conference on Computer Vision
* ECCV: European Conference on Computer Vision
* NIPS: Neural Information Processing Systems
* ICLR: International Conference on Learning Representations
* ICML: International Conference on Machine Learning
* Publications from the Stanford Vision Lab
* Awesome Deep Vision
* Past CS229 Projects: Example projects from Stanford's machine learning class
* Kaggle challenges: An online machine learning competition website. For example, a Yelp classification challenge.
